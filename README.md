# Medical Management System

This is was an A-Level project that I had made for my coursework. 

I created a medical management system where there are two levels of users: Admins and Nurses.

1. Admins: They are lead nurses who had access to create new nurse accounts and could edit patient details as well. They assign the patients that need to be visited to all the different nurses. 
   
2. Nurses: They are able to create new patients and edit their information. Only the patients that they are assigned will show up on their list.

Features: 
- Login and Logout (validation)
- New Registration (includes Email Authentication)
- Account Recovery
- Editable HTML Tables, using jQuery , which are directly connected to MySQL
- Two Level User Access (Admin and Nurses)
- Journey Planner for the nurse (Nurse selects the patient to be visited and they all pop on one singe map through Google Maps API)
- Still working on how to find the quickest route and displaying in order the patients to be visited. 

To see the code please go to the folder Quicklogin.
